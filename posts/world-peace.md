It's easy to say we want world peace. But as with so many other things, if we consider what that means, implementation rapidly skews to the radical.

If we define "World Peace" as the elimination of systematized state violence (ie, war and occupation), then world peace, by definition, would mean:

- An end to all occupation, everywhere: Tibet, Xinjiang, Palestine, Ukraine, Kurdistan, to name a few experiencing active and violent occupations.
- Reparation of the damages caused by occupations that have otherwise been completed. Both occupations of settlement (like the genocide perpetrated by thee United States against the American peoples), and internal occupations (the erasure of real cultural identities by national monoliths like Russia, Germany, China, Iran, and so on).
- An end to all coercive labor practices, everywhere. This would require a logistical leveling of the species / planet and likely the complete deconstruction of capitalism, to be replaced by a self-organizing system with an output of sustainability and human care rather than resource concentration and cancerous growth.
- Eliminations of systemic oppression within human groups. This includes: ethnic oppression, religious oppression, gender oppression, sexual oppression, etc etc: all limitation of human freedom based on identity group membership. This cuts both ways; no one could be _individually_ restricted from practicing their religious rights, but everyone would also be _individually_ protected from religious action. So children and women (for instance) would be protected from patriarchal religous control, even as those religious individuals were protected in their individual religious practice.
