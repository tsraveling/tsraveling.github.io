**I’m a senior iOS developer with seven years of iOS experience,** and ten years of professional programming experience, although programming has been a passion of mine since the first time I opened QBasic at the age of eleven on my parents’ ancient monochrome DOS machine.

I consider programming to be a craft, and like to make sure my code is **clean, elegant, well-commented, modular, and scalable.** When presented with a projected inherited from a previous developer that’s full of patchwork solutions and baling-twine engineering, I generally prefer to start with a clean slate and build solid from the ground up. Code architecture is the foundation upon which your app or website rests; failing to invest in it is challenging fate.

While my primary professional focus is in **iOS** with **Objective-C and Swift,** I’m also fluent in **Java, PHP, CSS, vanilla JS, jQuery, Python, C# and C++.** I’m also currently in the process of picking up node.js.

In addition to my [consulting business](/consulting), I’m also **currently available for hire.** Check out my [portfolio projects](/projects) for examples of my work, and [contact me](mailto:tsraveling@gmail.com) if you’d like to set up a time to meet.
