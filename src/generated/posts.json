The nonviolent marches were demonstrations of numbers and unity, and a loud refusal to remain submissive. This pushed whites and politicians to make a choice, either to instigate violence themselves, or to accept the new status quo. The American system of power is (at least somewhat) democratic, meaning politicians were forced to make decisions based not only on their own personal emotional response, but also the self-interested desire to remain in power -- which meant not committing public atrocities against the thousands of Black nonviolent protestors.\n- Gandhi marched to the sea with tens of thousands of people, again forcing the hands of the British. The economic benefits of colonialism -- mostly to the elite -- were outweighed again by an increasingly democratic system that relied on the support of **normal people** back home, with transparency provided by freedom of the press. Again it was either atrocity (which results in a loss of power within democratic systems) or acquiescence.\n\nA similar tactic is the **strike** which leverages the coercion of economic / infrastructural loss, which primarily harms the power structures of the elite.\n\n**However.**\n\n- In a fascist system democracy is already destroyed. Nonviolence is not an option against the State of Iran, because the power structure does not rely on the support of the people. In fact, the power structure is constructed in direct opposition to the people, using the divisive coercion tactics of cults and empires.\n- These techniques are only as good as the ethical sense of the dominant caste. The Civil Rights leaders of the 60s forced action, but the voting base only cared insomuch as Black bodies were under direct threat of violence and death. The more subtle forms of caste thinking, ie economic and cultural ones, were untouched by this movement because the main white bourgeois caste in the United States could not be made to care about them.\n",
