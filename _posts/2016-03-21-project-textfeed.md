From the marketing material:

>>>Textfeed is the largest searchable database of text responses in the world. Texts come from user submissions, original content, and aggregated material.

>>>They can be searched using a variety of categories. Sort them by most popular, trending, or most recently submitted.

>>>You can also use Textfeed as your own personal database of texts. Build a profile and decide whether to post your texts publicly or keep them in your private stash.

Textfeed includes social media integration, a fully custom SDK referencing the Textfeed API, and a number of responsive custom social media UI elements.
