Polarize exists to allow users to take photos of a place they’re hanging out in, and to check photos of that place before visiting. It uses a Google Maps and Google Places integration, and includes geolocation, photo and video capture. It was originally built using a Parse backend and is now running a custom Parse Server backend. I was the lead iOS engineer on this project at CabForward in Austin, TX.
