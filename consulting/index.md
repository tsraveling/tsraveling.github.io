Hi. My name's **Tim Raveling.** I'm an iOS engineer who's been in the game since the iPhone 2, and **have delivered dozens of apps** to the Apple App Store over those years. I'm familiar with nearly every conceivable technical problem an iOS app might face. I've seen a lot of apps fail, and a few succeed. As a senior engineer and freelancer (working with dozens of startup clients rather than a single monolithic corporation), **I'm uniquely positioned to let you know what bringing your idea to life is going to take.**

If that sounds good to you, I'm offering **a consulting package for $249.99** which will include the following:

- Signed NDA (optional)
- **Full technical review** of any design documents you might have
- **45 minute meeting** via Skype or phone where I review your idea in detail and explain what it will take to implement, as well as answer any technical questions you might have
- One-page **bulleted brief sheet** containing all the important information covered in the call
